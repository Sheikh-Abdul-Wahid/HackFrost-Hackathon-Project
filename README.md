# HackFrost Hackathon Project: Machine Learning Workflow for Expense Prediction
This project was developed as part of the HackFrost Hackathon. It uses Python and Kestra workflows to analyze monthly expenses, predict future expenses, and visualize the results. The workflow integrates Python scripts with Kestra to automate data processing, prediction, and visualization.

## üìÇ Project Structure:

Here‚Äôs an overview of the files in this repository:

- `detailed_expenses.csv`: The dataset containing monthly expense details.
- `kestra_hackfrost_hackathon_project.yaml`: The Kestra workflow configuration file that orchestrates the project tasks.
- `test_setup.py`: Python script to fetch and verify the dataset.
- `calculate_totals.py`: Python script to calculate monthly expense totals.
- `visualize_results.py`: Python script to predict next month‚Äôs expenses and generate visualizations.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Configuration to run Kestra locally using Docker Compose.

## üöÄ Features:

1. **Automated Workflow with Kestra**:  
The project uses `Kestra` workflows to manage tasks such as fetching data, processing it, and generating predictions.

2. **Expense Analysis**:  
Monthly expenses are analyzed, grouped, and sorted for better understanding.

3. **Expense Prediction**:  
`Linear Regression` is used to predict the expense for the next month based on historical data.

4. **Visualization**:  
A line plot with predictions highlights historical expenses and future projections.

5. **docker-compose.yml**:  
Configuration to run Kestra locally using Docker Compose.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Execution:

### Prerequisites
- Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on your system.
- Kestra: This project uses Kestra workflows, and the setup is managed through Docker Compose.

### Steps to Run
1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sheikh-Abdul-Wahid/HackFrost-Hackathon-Project.git
cd HackFrost-Hackathon-Project
```
2. **Run Kestra using Docker Compose**:
```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
Kestra will run on `http://localhost:8080`.

3. Upload the Kestra YAML file (`kestra_hackfrost_hackathon_project.yaml`) in the Kestra UI under "Flows" section.

4. **Execute the workflow in Kestra**:    
    - The workflow fetches the dataset, processes it, calculates monthly totals, predicts future expenses, and generates a visualization.

5. **View outputs**:  
    - Predicted expenses: `predicted_expense.csv`
    - Visualization: `monthly_expenses_plot.png`

## üìä Outputs:
  - `monthly_total_expenses.csv`: Processed data containing total expenses per month.
  - `predicted_expense.csv`: Predicted expense for the next month.
  - `monthly_expenses_plot.png`: A line plot showing historical and predicted expenses.

## üß∞ Tools and Libraries Used:
  - Kestra: Workflow orchestration.
  - Python: Data processing and analysis.
  - Pandas: Data manipulation.
  - Matplotlib: Visualization.
  - scikit-learn: Linear regression for prediction.
  - Requests: Fetching data from external sources (e.g., GitHub).
  - NumPy: Numerical computations and array manipulation.

## üéØ Objective:  

The project aims to demonstrate how workflows can automate tasks such as data analysis and prediction using Python and Kestra.
